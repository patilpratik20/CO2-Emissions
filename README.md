# Predicting-CO2-Emission-
This project aims to analyse a dataset provided by the Canadian Government, detailing the
amount of CO2 emissions from vehicles. Our focus lies in identifying the impact of different
variables on CO2 emissions, examining the intricacies of how emissions vary when fuel
consumption is considered separately. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature
selection, and the implementation of advanced machine learning models, our objective is to
find insights that contribute to a good understanding of CO2 emission patterns.
We implemented the following models:
1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. Random Forest
3. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
4. XGBoost
5. CatBoost (Implemented from Research Paper)
